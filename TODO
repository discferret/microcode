To-do list for the DiscFerret microcode:

-- DFE-3 stream format (disc reader)
    * 16 bit word length
       * 14 bit counter
       * 2 bit flag word
         00   Carry (counter must have all bits set to 1)
         01   Index pulse caused store
         10   Data pulse caused store
         11   Index and data pulse occurred at the same time

    This will involve extending the size of the FIFO to 16 bits, then changing the DiscReader to handle this. Finally the RAM write logic must be altered to allow 8bit writes from the PIC, and 16bit ones from the FIFO. Will probably need a proper state-machine arbiter for this.
