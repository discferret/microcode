To-do list for the DiscFerret microcode:
  - Improve data compression in the DiscReader engine
  - Timing model for the DiscWriter engine
  - Proper documentation
  - Testbenches for DiscReader and DiscWriter

Things implemented on branches:
  - 16-bit disc reader -- this is on the 16BIT_DISCREADER branch but has issues.
    When sampling at 100MHz, it generally reduces the amount of data stored. At 50MHz or 25MHz, it *increases* it by a significant amount. See Mantis bug #3 for more information on this.
