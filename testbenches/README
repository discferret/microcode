DiscFerret Microcode Test Suite (MTS)
=====================================

This directory contains a series of test suites for various parts of the
DiscFerret design (those which were written in pure Verilog HDL and can be
adequately simulated inside Icarus Verilog).


Requirements
------------
In order to run the testbenches, you will need:

  - Icarus Verilog 0.9 or later
    On Debian-based Linux systems, this is in the 'iverilog' package. You may
    also want the 'gtkwave' waveform viewer if you're planning on debugging the
    testbench or writing new tests.

  - GNU Make (just about any fairly recent version will do)


Running testbenches
-------------------
For the most part, the testbenches are automatic. Pick a directory (for
instance, DiscReader), 'cd' into it, and type 'make'. The testbench will be
compiled, then run inside the Icarus Verilog runtime.

Each test is delimited on screen by a header line, may contain a series of debug
lines, and is concluded with a trailer line and a blank line. In the event that
a test fails, the test suite will abort and display an error message pointing to
the cause of the failure.


ModelSim compatibility
----------------------
It is entirely possible that the MTS test suite might work under ModelSim,
however this:

  - Has not been tested
  - Is not supported
  - Is probably not a good idea
